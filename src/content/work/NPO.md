### A dream to serve

Studying abroad poses numerous challenges, including culture shock, feelings of loneliness, and heightened stress during unforeseen problems with nobody to turn to. I've had the privilege to not only volunteer for but also to lead the largest and oldest Thai student association in Japan. In collaboration with government officials, businesses, and other student volunteers, I strive to enhance the well-being of hundreds of Thai students across Japan.

### Organization Management and Leadership

Serving as the Vice President in charge of event management and human resources, I play a pivotal role in organizing events to foster student connections and promote our sponsors' businesses. In my last project, I led a team of over 20 members for six months, orchestrating a large-scale event that garnered hundreds of attendees.

### Collaboration

Being an organization under royal patronage, our primary supporter is the Thai government. This affiliation necessitates close collaboration with Thai officials in Japan, involving initiatives ranging from distributing masks to students during the pandemic to providing essential financial support. These experiences have honed my organizational, networking, and public speaking skills, equipping me with valuable tools for future endeavors.
