  As a graduate of college of technology, I haven't forgot my old trade.
  Be it AutoCAD Mechanical, drill mill, all the way to the lathe !

> Dual Experience of both Kosen and University

\* Kosen is College of Technology in Japanese

### Traditional tools
As a mandatory part of the Kosen curriculum, I have gained practical experience with traditional factory machines like lathes, drill mills, and welding guns. These experiences have provided invaluable insights into product design, metal processing, and the organization of production steps, all acquired through hands-on learning.

### Modern tools
Beyond traditional machinery, I have been fortunate enough to engage with modern tools such as AutoCAD Mechanical, 3D printers, and microcontrollers. This exposure to contemporary technologies has further enriched my skill set and allowed me to bridge the gap between traditional and modern engineering tools.

### Combining them together
One notable project during my time at Akashi Kosen is the development of a basic prototype cooling system. This machine is built with a microcontroller based on our practical understanding of the grinding process, combining practical and technical skills. It aims to control the temperature of the grinding stone to solve some common challenges in the grinding process and enhance factory productivity.
