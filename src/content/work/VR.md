### To Go Beyond the Screen
Having delved fairly deep into the realms of Computer Graphics (CG), navigating the intricacies of both modern Path Tracing and traditional OpenGL, I now find myself wondering at the edge of a new frontier: Extended Realities (XR). Envision a scenario where a fluid simulation transcends the confines of a screen, where researchers don't just observe but are completely immersed in the phenomenon they study. The potential for breathtaking and powerful visualizations in XR is truly awe-inspiring.
With this vision propelling me forward, I've set my sights on the fertile ground of XR, using Oculus Quest and Unity as my starting point. My initial experimentation has birthed a rudimentary VR world, where users can not only observe the fluid-structure in three dimensions. It's a very modest start, but it marks the foundation upon which I am determined to build the next step of my work.
