My team of 4 nationalities received the best sustainability business pitch award, NUS Green Hackathon (a student-held hackathon)

### Advancing Sustainability through Research

I have been fortunate enough to have earned recognition from the Asahi Glass Foundation for the potential of my research endeavors. This esteemed foundation is committed to contributing to the creation of a more sustainable society and fostering exceptional human resources. By being a part of this organization, alongside the full research scholarship, I also have had the privilege of engaging with like-minded individuals who share the common dream of a greener tomorrow. These collaborative exchanges transcend various backgrounds, ranging from computer science to agriculture, offering me a perspective on how diverse talents can unite to address the challenge of building a sustainable future.

### Bridging Research and Business for a Greener Tomorrow

As we confront imminent climate challenges, the path to effective solutions involves not only rigorous research into sustainable technologies but also a symbiotic relationship with the business world to empower these innovations to make a tangible impact. Indeed, my decision to embark on an exchange at NUS is motivated by a desire to deepen my understanding of the business landscape. During my time in Singapore, I actively participated in a club dedicated to sustainable entrepreneurship, experienced the workings of a green start-up, and won a prize in a student hackathon focused on green business. These experiences have provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of the business world, equipping me with a strategic perspective on how to amplify the real-world impact of my work.
