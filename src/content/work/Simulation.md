### Emulating Nature's Complexity
As a Millennium problem, the Navier-Stokes Equation poses a formidable challenge, if not an impossibility for analytical solutions. Despite the intricacy, understanding it is pivotal, given our constant interaction with fluids in both engineering applications and daily life. Fortunately, the situation changes significantly when delving into numerical solutions. Leveraging the computational power of modern machines, we can simulate fluid behavior by tracking its evolution over infinitesimally small time incremently, providing us with the capability to predict flows at any desired moment.
Numerous methods exist for such numerical simulations, and my chosen approach is the Immersed Boundary Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM). Renowned for its simplicity, proficiency in handling complex geometries, and compatibility with parallel computing.

### The Technology of a Thousand Usages
Applying simulation results to practical scenarios, our research group has made fascinating discoveries, some even leading to patented industrial machines like the innovative bladeless mixer—designed by my seniors and professors. This stands as an exemple of how fluid simulation technologies transcend theory, with impactful real-world applications ranging from car design to coronavirus prevention. The art of simulation has seamlessly woven itself into the fabric of modern engineering, proving integral in shaping innovative solutions across diverse fields.
